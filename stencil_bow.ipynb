        "Welcome to your first assignment! In this assignment, you will be implementing your very first NLP model (woohoo!) - a bag-of-words (BOW) model for sentiment classification. You will be using a very useful NLP libary (spaCy), and a popular machine learning library (scikit-learn, or sklearn) to help you with preprocessing the data and building the BOW model. In later lectures and assignments, you will learn to implement many of these NLP and machine learning functions yourself, but in \"the real world\" it is often more practical to use existing libraries, like those provided by spaCy and sklearn, than to implement these algorithms from scratch. So here we want you to learn how to use these libraries in a practical setting, and we'll learn later more about how they work \"under the hood\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The main learning objectives for this assignment are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use sklearn to implement a standard ML workflow (featurization, designing train-test splits, training a model, and evaluating the model).\n",
        "2. Use spaCy for standard NLP preprocessing steps (tokenization, lemmatization, tagging).\n",
        "3. Understand and implement common featurization approaches for text classifiers (ngrams, weighting schemas, tagging).\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic workflow for an NLP model contains the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load and explore the data\n",
        "2. Preprocess the data\n",
        "3. Extract features\n",
        "4. Train the model\n",
        "5. Evaluate the model\n",
        "6. Analyze model behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "You will implement this full workflow in Part 1. In Part 2, you will experiment with improvements to step 2 (preprocessing). In Part 3, you will experiment with improvements to step 3 (featurization)."
